## Libraries Used

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React DOM:** Renders React components to the DOM.
- **Canvas API:** Used for drawing the mask on the image.
- **CSS:** For styling the app, including animations and responsiveness

### Challenges Faced and Solutions

#### *1. Canvas Drawing Functionality*
- **Challenge:** It was difficult to ensure that the mask was drawn correctly on the uploaded image, with proper alignment and scaling.
- **Solution:** Used React's useRef to manipulate the canvas and ensured that the canvas size matched the uploaded image's dimensions to keep the drawing aligned.

#### *2. Brush Size Adjustment*
- **Challenge:** Dynamically adjusting the brush size during drawing was tricky.
- **Solution:** Used React state (useState) to store the brush size and passed it to the canvas drawing function to adjust the line width in real-time.

#### *3. Canvas Resizing*
- **Challenge:** Resizing the canvas according to the uploaded image while preserving the aspect ratio was challenging.
- **Solution:** Used useEffect to dynamically adjust the canvas size when a new image was uploaded, ensuring that it matched the imageâ€™s aspect ratio.

#### *4. Exporting the Mask*
- **Challenge:** Saving the drawn mask correctly with the white areas representing the mask and black areas for the background was complex.
- **Solution:** Used the canvas.toDataURL('image/png') function to export the mask as a PNG file, ensuring that the drawn area was white and the background was black.
